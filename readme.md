# ML Pipeline Development Project  

## üìã Introduction  
This project focuses on building an **Machine Learning (ML) pipeline** that manages the entire lifecycle‚Äîfrom **data ingestion and preprocessing to model deployment**. The pipeline ensures fast iterations, optimal model selection, and seamless usability, making it suitable for both ML experts and non-experts.  

## üéØ Objectives  
- Provide a **modular pipeline** that supports customization at each stage.  
- Offer a **user-friendly interface** for model selection, evaluation, and reporting.  
- Ensure **reproducibility** and consistency of results across multiple experiments.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features  
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Supports **CSV** and **XLSX** file formats.  
   - Flexible data storage and retrieval modules.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualizes data with **correlation heatmaps** and **scatter plots**.  
   - Detects and analyzes outliers using **box plots** and **descriptive analysis**.  

3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handles missing data with **imputation techniques** (mean, median, or random sample).  
   - Identifies and removes outliers using **Tukey‚Äôs Method** or **Z-Score filtering**.  

4. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Selects the best features using **ExtraTreesClassifier**-based importance ranking.  
   - Supports **target variable selection** for optimized training.  

5. **Feature Scaling:**  
   - Includes **MinMaxScaler** and **StandardScaler** for normalization.  

6. **Model Selection & Tuning:**  
   - Supports **binary** and **multiclass classification** algorithms.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** or manual tuning.  

7. **Ensembling & Evaluation:**  
   - Combines models with **ensemble techniques** to improve accuracy.  
   - Reports performance metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC**.  

8. **Report Generation & Export:**  (under-development)
   - Generates **classification reports** and **evaluation summaries**.  
   - Allows users to **export trained models** as `.tflite` or `.pkl` files.  


## üìà Workflow Overview  
1. **Data Input:** Load datasets from various sources.  
2. **EDA:** Explore data patterns with statistical and visual analysis.  
3. **Preprocessing:** Clean and scale data for optimal model performance.  
4. **Model Selection:** Train multiple models and tune hyperparameters.  
5. **Evaluation:** Use metrics and visualizations to assess performance.  
6. **Deployment:** Export trained models for further use.
